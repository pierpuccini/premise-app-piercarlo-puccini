A bare-bones app with no styling that contains a FE & BE.
The BE can extract information from the metmuseum where we first get a list of object id's per our query and then we fetch each object.
The FE Connects to our BE and consumes a search GET endpoint in order to get a list of objects containing information
such as artist, medium, department, location, and a redirect to the museums wiki
